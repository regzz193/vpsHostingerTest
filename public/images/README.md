# Images Directory

This directory is intended for storing images that need to be publicly accessible in the application.

## Usage

### Storing Images

You can store images in this directory by:
1. Manually copying files to this directory
2. Using Laravel's file upload functionality to save files here

### Accessing Images in Code

You can access images in this directory using Laravel's Storage facade:

```php
// Store an uploaded file in the images directory
$path = $request->file('image')->store('/', 'images');

// Get the URL for an image
$url = Storage::disk('images')->url($path);

// Check if an image exists
$exists = Storage::disk('images')->exists($path);

// Delete an image
Storage::disk('images')->delete($path);
```

### Accessing Images in Blade Templates

You can reference images in your Blade templates like this:

```html
<img src="{{ asset('images/your-image.jpg') }}" alt="Description">
```

## Important Notes

1. This directory is publicly accessible, so do not store sensitive images here.
2. For user-uploaded content, consider implementing validation to ensure only appropriate images are stored.
3. For large applications, consider using a CDN or cloud storage solution like AWS S3 for better performance and scalability.
